1 month Sql learning 

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning

Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of databases and using this space to practice and document what I learn along the way.

Things I'm focusing on:

Getting comfortable with everyday SQL commands like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.

Writing and improving complex queries that actually solve real problems

Learning how to design clean, efficient databases through normalization

Getting a feel for stored procedures, views, and triggers â€” just the basics for now

Practicing how to filter, sort, and summarize data to find insights

Understanding how relational databases work behind the scenes

Sketching out simple data models and schema designs

ðŸ”§ Tools I'm Using
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

Interfaces: MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or whatever gets the job done

Writing queries in SQL editors, and keeping things organized with Git & GitHub

Occasionally using Python or Excel for quick data checks or handling
